// Camera ground-guard policy tests: pure arithmetic, no scene, no network.
//
// Arrival framing is computed before the destination's tiles exist, so it works
// from a PREDICTED ground height. Measured cold at one test site the DEM came back
// ~134 m below the rendered surface, often after the flight had already happened,
// and the preset fallback defaults to sea level, so the eye ends up buried by
// roughly the local elevation. The guard measures the real surface after arrival
// and lifts the eye; these tests pin when it acts.
//
// Heights below use Denver (~1,609 m) as the worked example.
//
// Run with: npm test   (node --test)
