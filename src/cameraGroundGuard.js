/**
 * Camera ground guard: never leave the eye buried in, or pressed against, terrain.
 *
 * Arrival framing is computed BEFORE the destination's tiles exist, so it has to
 * guess the ground height. Every available guess is unreliable:
 *   - `globe.getHeight()` is structurally dead here (the globe is hidden under the
 *     photorealistic tileset, and no terrain provider is installed),
 *   - the curated `groundElevation` presets cover only a handful of cities,
 *   - and the DEM service resolves asynchronously. Measured cold at one test site
 *     it came back ~134 m below the rendered surface, often not before the flight.
 *
 * Guessing low is not a cosmetic error. The fallback defaults to sea level, so the
 * eye ends up buried by roughly the local elevation: ~1,609 m over Denver, ~2,240 m
 * over Mexico City. Both render a black frame.
 *
 * So this module does not guess. After the flight lands, once tiles are actually
 * streamed in and `scene.sampleHeight` is trustworthy, it measures the surface the
 * user is really looking at and lifts the camera if it is below a usable clearance.
 * Ground truth beats every prediction, and it is only available afterwards.
